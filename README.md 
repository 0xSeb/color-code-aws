# Color coding env aws

This extension has for purpose to color code differents environnements in the AWS console based on the account number.

## Why ? 

* Once you mess up accounts between prod and stage, you don't it to happen ever again.
* The account numbers are usually very similar and if you don't pay attention or switch envs frequently, it's easy to lose track of which env you're actually in.

# How to use it

Copy the *main.dist.js* file to *main.js*, replace the account numbers, colors, etc.
